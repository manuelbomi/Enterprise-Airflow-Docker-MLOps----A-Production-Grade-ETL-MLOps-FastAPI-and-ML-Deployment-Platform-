# Enterprise Airflow Docker MLOps: A Production Grade ETL, MLOps, FastAPI, and ML Deployment Platform

#### Enterprise Airflow Docker MLOps is a production-grade, modular platform that demonstrates how to orchestrate end-to-end data engineering and MLOps workflows using Apache Airflow (TaskFlow API), Docker, Airflow Xcom and FastAPI.

Designed with enterprise use cases in mind, this project showcases how to:

- Build and manage ETL pipelines for data transformation

- Automate machine learning model training, validation, and deployment

- Leverage CI/CD pipelines to enforce quality and maintain workflow integrity

- Enable real-time model inference via FastAPI

- Use Airflow’s advanced features like XCom, backfilling, catchup, and custom plugins

- Ensure model reliability through baseline validation, model versioning, and registry logic

* Whether your team is building AI/ML pipelines, automating data workflows, or deploying models in enterprise production environments, this project provides a battle-tested starting point that is extensible, containerized, and CI/CD-ready.
